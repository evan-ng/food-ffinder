# Food FFinder
A map application written in C++ using an API to query lower level OpenStreetMap data and the libcurl library to access restaurant data in Google's Places API.

## Features
 * Read data from Open Street Map database
 * Use the libcurl library to access restaurant data from Google's Places API
 * Graphical interface built using GTK <br><br>
 * Dijkstra's algorithm with A* heuristics
 * Travelling salesman problem (with added constraints) using a nearest neighbour algorithm and iterative optimization algorithms <br><br>
 * Search autocomplete for streets, points of interest (restaurants), and intersections
 * Information toggles to display or hide map features and non-restaurant locations
 * Clear navigation directions to indicated destinations
 * Dark mode <br><br>
 * Runtime optimization by precomputing map information and using multi-threading
